# snyk-bulk

`Dockerfile` entrypoints that replicate `snyk monitor â€”all-projects` on a per language basis.

__Useful for:__
* flexible testing of monorepos
* discovery-oriented vulnerability scanning
  * contents are not known ahead of time
  * scanning "out-of-band", that is not directly in the developer build pipeline

## Examples
`docker build -t snyk-bulk:python3 -f Dockerfile-python .`
